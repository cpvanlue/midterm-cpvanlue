# Midsemester Ex(j)am: The Public Domain Platformer
A project by Caleb Van Lue.

## How to Play
The objective of this game is to make your way across the land, collecting as many coins and killing as many enemies as possible. The end of the course is marked by a flag, which will mark your completion once reaching it. To move left, use 'A' or Left, and to move right, use 'D' or Right. To crouch, hold 'S' or Down. To jump, press Space. To sprint, hold Shift. 

Each coin and enemy kill results in a score increase of 10. To kill enemies, you must jump on their heads (beware, janky). If an enemy hits you from the side, you will lose 10 points. If you make it to the end of the level, your score will increase by 100 per second remaining on the timer!

## Project Report
This project was actually quite special to me. Over the past few weeks, I've been in a mental health slump and have deeply struggled with completing assignments and going to class. After being assigned this project, I began to feel a bit more motivation. There are a lot of creative liberties left for the programmer in this exercise, which provoked my thoughts and gave me reason to think. Using the criticisms on my previous (mediocre) assignments has led me to cleaner and more readable code as well as a more enjoyable experience for the player. I felt inspired by the project 2 requirements from this semester, but I wanted to expand upon them a bit more. Though inspired, I started from scratch to create a cleaner implementation. I decided to implement enemies in this project, something I did not do in any previous one. I also wanted to make the movement more fun, so I decided to add sprint and crouch abilities, alongside the normal jump and walk. I also took some creative liberties when designing the level, which is more fun (and challenging) than it seems. 

Overall, this project has given me a bit more purpose over the past few dull weeks and I'm proud of the game that I put forward. Dedicating "one day" of my week to prototyping a platformer that I'd love to create was hoenstly a very fun time. I knew I would likely have to limit myself as to not overdo it, but I also knew that I could expand upon some project 2 requirements. I do wish I had more time to polish things like my characters' physics movement and the enemies' collision with the player, but obviously I'm unable to create a Mario-level physics engine in eight hours. I'm really proud of the work I've created in this past week.
